This utility written in C, permit to display a distribution graph
on terminal, the input MUST be provided as integer once for line. 
the utility permit to do a cat from log and generate a terminal 
timing rapresentation as example. It's a real quick and dirty solution 
you will probably look for R for some more advanced statistical solution. 
But for a quick term solution is not so bad : |

while true;
  echo "         TITLE GRAPH          "
  do tail -n 100 PMS.log|grep Logic|grep -v WSDL|awk 'BEGIN { FS = ";" } ; { print $6 }'|a,out
  sleep 10
done

First column rapresent the hit rate for the first interval, ie 0-1000, on the left is display a recup for each interval.

a.out [column_rage] [x_size] [y_size]
